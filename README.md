Welcome to My Sliding Landscape Puzzle Game!

I grew up playing jigsaw puzzles and always loved spending hours trying to complete a 1000 piece puzzle on the weekends with my grandmother. With this puzzle users can complete their own puzzles solo or with their families virtually!

Give my puzzle game a whirl and tell me what you think.
